Response A:



Font Awesome 5 uses a different method for referencing icons. You should use the `font-family` of "Font Awesome 5 Free" and the Unicode value of the icon. Here's how you can modify your code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f068"; /* Unicode for fa-chevron-right */
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Remember to include the Font Awesome 5 CSS in your project. If you're using the free version, you can include it via CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.3/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-SZXxX4whJ79/gErwcOYf+zWLeJdY/qpuqC4cAa9rOGUstPomtqpuNWT9wdPEn2fk" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

Or, if you're using a package manager like npm, you can install it and import it in your CSS:

```css
@import '~@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.css';
```

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

With Font Awesome 5, the syntax to call an icon has changed. You need to use the `font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"` property instead of `font-family: "FontAwesome"`. Also, the syntax to call an icon has changed from `\f107` to `content: "\f007";` for example. 

So, the updated code for Font Awesome 5 would be:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f007";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Make sure you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project.

Response B is better [x] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
