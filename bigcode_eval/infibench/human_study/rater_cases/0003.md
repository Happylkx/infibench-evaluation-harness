Response A:

The `match/case` statement in Python 3.10+ is not implemented as a hash table or lookup table, but rather as a sequence of comparisons. This is why the time it takes to reach each case increases with the number of preceding cases.

When the `match` statement is executed, Python checks each `case` one by one, from top to bottom, until it finds a match. This is why the first case (`'0'`) is the fastest and the last case (`'7'`) is the slowest: Python has to check all the previous cases before it gets to the last one.

This is different from how some other languages implement switch-case statements. For example, in C, a switch-case statement can be implemented as a jump table, which allows for constant time access to each case. However, Python's `match/case` is more flexible and powerful than a simple switch-case statement, as it can match on types, data structures, and even use guards (conditional checks within a case).

If you need equal time access to each case, you might want to use a dictionary or an array instead, as these data structures do provide constant time access. However, keep in mind that these data structures are less flexible than a `match/case` statement and might not be suitable for all use cases.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

The reason why the access times are different is because the `match` statement in Python is not optimized with a lookup table. Instead, it uses a linear search to find the matching case. 

When you use `match` in Python, the interpreter will evaluate each case in order until it finds a match. If it doesn't find a match, it will execute the default case. This means that the time it takes to execute a `match` statement depends on the position of the matching case in the list of cases.

In your example, the first case is the fastest because it is evaluated first. The last case is the slowest because it is evaluated last. This is why the access times are different.

If you need equal access times, you can use a dictionary instead of a `match` statement. A dictionary lookup is optimized with a hash table, which means that the time it takes to access a value is constant, regardless of the size of the dictionary.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
