------
Response A:

```csharp
public Person() : this(0, string.Empty, string.Empty) { }
```

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:



```c#
public Person() : this(0, string.Empty, string.Empty) { }
```
This code creates a new constructor with no parameters that initializes the `Id` field to 0, and the `FirstName` and `LastName` fields to empty strings.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
