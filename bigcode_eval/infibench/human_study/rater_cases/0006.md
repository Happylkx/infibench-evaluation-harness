Response A:

Here is your code with the `copyText` method filled:

```html
<template>
    <div id="app">
      <v-app id="inspire">
        <v-container>
          <v-text-field v-model="text1"></v-text-field>
          <v-btn @click="copyText">copy</v-btn>
        </v-container>
      </v-app>
    </div>
</template>

<script>
    new Vue({
      el: '#app',
      vuetify: new Vuetify(),
      data() { 
        return {
          text1: 'lorem ipsum 123'
        }
      },
      methods: {
        copyText () {
          navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.text1).then(() => {
            console.log('Copying to clipboard was successful!');
          }, err => {
            console.error('Could not copy text: ', err);
          });
        }
      }
    })
</script>
```

In the `copyText` method, we are using the Clipboard API's `writeText` method to copy the text from `text1` to the clipboard. This method returns a promise that resolves once the text is successfully written to the clipboard. If the operation fails for any reason, the promise will reject with an error, which we log to the console.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



```html
<script>
    new Vue({
      el: '#app',
      vuetify: new Vuetify(),
      data() {
        return {
          text1: 'lorem ipsum 123'
        }
      },
      methods: {
        copyText () {
          navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.text1)
            .then(() => {
              console.log('Text copied to clipboard...')
            })
            .catch(err => {
              console.error('Could not copy text: ', err)
            })
        }
      }
    })
</script>
```

In the `copyText` method, I've used the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` function to copy the text from the `text1` data property to the clipboard. This function returns a promise that resolves if the text is successfully copied, and rejects if there's an error. I've added `then` and `catch` handlers to log a message to the console in each case.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
