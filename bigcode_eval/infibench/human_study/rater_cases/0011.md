Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

The error message suggests that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a Config Server, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This is strange, since you say that your project is not a Config Server and does not use Config Server.

One possible explanation is that some of your dependencies are pulling in the `spring-cloud-config-client` library, which enables applications to use a Config Server to manage their configuration. This library may be trying to import configuration from a Config Server, even though you are not using it explicitly.

To fix this issue, you can try excluding the `spring-cloud-config-client` dependency from your project. You can do this by adding the following exclusion to your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config') {
    exclude group: 'org.springframework.cloud', module: 'spring-cloud-config-client'
}
```

This will exclude the `spring-cloud-config-client` library from the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency, which should prevent it from trying to import configuration from a Config Server.

Alternatively, you can try setting the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property to `false` in your test properties:

```
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

This should disable the Config Server configuration import altogether, which should also fix the issue.

Response B is better [x] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
