------
Response A:



Here is the function:

```python
def extractCellValue(df, matchedString):
    # Find the row where instrument_token matches the given string
    matched_row = df[df['instrument_token'] == matchedString]

    # If a match is found, return the corresponding tradingsymbol
    if not matched_row.empty:
        return matched_row['tradingsymbol'].values[0]
    else:
        return None
```

You can use this function to extract the `tradingsymbol` for a given `instrument_token` from your DataFrame. For example:

```python
tradingsymbol = extractCellValue(df, "123")
print(tradingsymbol)  # Outputs: 'xyz'
```

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

You can use the `loc` method of pandas DataFrame to filter the rows based on the condition and then extract the value from the `tradingsymbol` column.

Here's the Python code for the `extractCellValue` function:

```python
def extractCellValue(df, matchedString):
    row = df.loc[df['instrument_token'] == matchedString]
    return row['tradingsymbol'].values[0]
```

You can call this function by passing your DataFrame and the matched string as arguments. For example:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'instrument_token': [123, 555, 34, 189],
    'tradingsymbol': ['xyz', 'aaa', 'rst', 'op'],
    'lot_size': [1000, 200, 2400, 780]
})

matchedString = 123

result = extractCellValue(df, matchedString)
print(result)
```

This will output:

```
xyz
```

Note that the `values[0]` is used to extract the first value from the `tradingsymbol` column, as there will be only one row returned by the `loc` method.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
