Response A:

You can use the `numpy.max()` function with the `axis` parameter set to 1 and the `keepdims` parameter set to True to get the maximum value of each row. Then, you can use indexing to get the third column of each row and reshape the resulting array to a 2D array with one column. Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    max_values = np.max(matrix, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    third_column = max_values[:, 2]
    result = third_column.reshape(-1, 1)
    return result
```

You can call this function with your example array:

```python
matrix = np.array([[[4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 7],
                   [7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 5],
                   [6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6],
                   [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 1],
                   [2, 8, 6, 7, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 1]],
                  
                  [[9, 9, 5, 8, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 1],
                   [9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 0],
                   [1, 0, 4, 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8],
                   [8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8],
                   [4, 0, 2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4]],
                  
                  [[1, 6, 2, 4, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 3],
                   [9, 6, 8, 6

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



The function should be:

- Simple
- Efficient
- Readable

Here is the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    return np.max(matrix[:, :, 2], axis=1, keepdims=True)
```

This function works as expected. It uses the np.max function to find the maximum value along the third axis (column index 2) of the input matrix. The axis=1 argument specifies that the maximum should be taken over the rows, and the keepdims=True argument ensures that the output has the same number of dimensions as the input.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
