------
Response A:

Sure, the issue is that you're returning an object instead of a constructor function. Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` returns a mock function that can be used as a constructor. When you call `new API()`, it will return the object `{someMethod: () => {}}`.

Response A is better [x] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:



```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a class
  return class API {
    someMethod() {}
  };
});
```

In the revised version, the mock function returns a class instead of an object. This allows you to create an instance of the class using the `new` keyword.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
