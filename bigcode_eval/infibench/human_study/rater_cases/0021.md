Response A:

You can use a for loop to iterate over each tensor in the list and print its size using the `size()` method of PyTorch tensors. Here's the implementation of the `getSize` function:

```python
import torch

def getSize(t):
    for tensor in t:
        print(tensor.size())
```

You can call this function with your list of PyTorch tensors as follows:

```python
t = [
    torch.tensor([[-0.2781, -0.2567, -0.2353,  ..., -0.9640, -0.9855, -1.0069],  
                  [-0.2781, -0.2567, -0.2353,  ..., -1.0069, -1.0283, -1.0927],  
                  [-0.2567, -0.2567, -0.2138,  ..., -1.0712, -1.1141, -1.1784],  
                  ...,  
                  [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.6211,  ..., -1.0712, -1.1141, -1.0927],  
                  [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.5997,  ..., -0.9426, -0.9640, -0.9640],  
                  [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.5997,  ..., -0.9640, -0.9426, -0.9426]]),
    torch.tensor([[-0.0769, -0.0980, -0.0769,  ..., -0.9388, -0.9598, -0.9808],  
                  [-0.0559, -0.0769, -0.0980,  ..., -0.9598, -1.0018, -1.0228],    
                  [-0.0559, -0.0769, -0.0769,  ..., -1.0228, -1.0439, -1.0859],  
                  ...,  
                  [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -1.0018, -1.0439, -1.0228],  
                  [-

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

Sure, you can use the `size()` method provided by PyTorch to get the shape of a tensor. Here is a function that iterates over the list of tensors and prints the size of each tensor:

```python
def getSize(t):
    sizes = [tensor.size() for tensor in t]
    return sizes
```

This function will return a list of sizes, where each size is a tuple representing the shape of the corresponding tensor in the input list. 

For example, if you have a list of 2D tensors, each of size (3, 3), the function will return `[(3, 3), (3, 3), ...]`.

Remember to import PyTorch at the beginning of your script:

```python
import torch
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
t = [torch.rand(3, 3) for _ in range(5)]  # a list of 5 tensors of size (3, 3)
print(getSize(t))  # prints [(3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3)]
```

Response B is better [x] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
