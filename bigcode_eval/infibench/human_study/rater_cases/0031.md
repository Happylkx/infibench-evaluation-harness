Response A:



Here is the Python code for the function:

```python
def func(n, k):
    # Initialize the count of strings with first character
    # being same.
    count1 = k

    # Initialize the count of strings with first 2 characters
    # being same.
    count2 = k * (k - 1)

    # Initialize the count of strings with no character
    # being same.
    count3 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)

    # Use above counts to get counts for remaining indexes.
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        temp = count3
        count3 = (count1 + count2) * (k - 2)
        count1 = count2
        count2 = temp

    return count1 + count2 + count3
```

This function works by initializing the counts of strings for the first three cases and then using these counts to calculate the counts for the remaining cases. The counts are updated in each iteration of the loop. Finally, the function returns the sum of the counts for all cases.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).

Response B:

Here is the Python function `func` that computes the number of ways to form a string of length `n` using `k` characters such that at most two adjacent characters can be same.

```python
def func(n, k):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return k
    else:
        same, diff = k, k*(k-1)
        for _ in range(3, n+1):
            same, diff = diff, (same + diff) * (k-1)
        return same + diff
```

This function works by using dynamic programming. It keeps track of two variables, `same` and `diff`, which represent the number of ways to form a string where the last two characters are the same and where the last two characters are different, respectively.

Initially, for a string of length 1, there are `k` ways to form a string where the last two characters are the same (since there's only one character), and for a string of length 2, there are `k*(k-1)` ways to form a string where the last two characters are different.

Then, for each additional character, the number of ways to form a string where the last two characters are the same is equal to the number of ways to form a string where the last two characters are different for the previous string (since we can just add the same character as the last one), and the number of ways to form a string where the last two characters are different is equal to the sum of the number of ways to form a string where the last two characters are the same and different for the previous string, multiplied by `k-1` (since we can add any character except the last one).

Finally, the total number of ways to form a string of length `n` is the sum of the number of ways to form a string where the last two characters are the same and different.

Response B is better [x] (label [x]) to select)
