Response A:


Unfortunately, the default repositories of most Linux distributions do not have the latest version of CMake. If you want to install the latest version, you can download it from the official CMake website and install it manually.

Here are the steps:

1. Download the latest version of CMake from the official website: https://cmake.org/download/

2. Extract the downloaded file:

```bash
tar -xzvf cmake-<version>.tar.gz
```

3. Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd cmake-<version>
```

4. Configure the build:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

5. Build and install CMake:

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

6. Verify the installation:

```bash
cmake --version
```

This will install the latest version of CMake on your system.

Response B:

You can try the following steps to install the latest version of CMake on your Linux environment:

1. Remove the existing CMake installation using the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get remove cmake
   ```

2. Download the latest version of CMake from the official website using the following command:

   ```
   wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.3/cmake-3.21.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   ```

   Note: You can check for the latest version and download link from the official CMake website.

3. Extract the downloaded file using the following command:

   ```
   tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   ```

4. Move the extracted folder to the /opt directory using the following command:

   ```
   sudo mv cmake-3.21.3-linux-x86_64 /opt/cmake-3.21.3
   ```

5. Create a symbolic link for the CMake executable using the following command:

   ```
   sudo ln -s /opt/cmake-3.21.3/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake
   ```

6. Verify the installation by checking the CMake version using the following command:

   ```
   cmake --version
   ```

   This should display the latest version of CMake that you have installed.

Note: The above steps assume that you are using a 64-bit Linux environment. If you are using a different architecture, you will need to download the appropriate version of CMake from the official website.
