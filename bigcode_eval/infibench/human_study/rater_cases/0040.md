Response A:



```javascript
this.repository.getById(Ids).subscribe((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  this.newIds = response.map((id) => id);
  console.log(this.newIds);
});
```

In the revised code, I have moved the `console.log(this.newIds)` inside the subscribe block. This ensures that it is executed after the response is received and `this.newIds` is assigned a value.

Response A is better [x] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

```javascript
this.repository.getById(Ids).subscribe((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  this.newIds = response.map((id) => {
    return id;
  });
  console.log(this.newIds);
});
```

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
