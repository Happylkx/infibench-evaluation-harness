Response A:

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with the `>` operator. 

Tailwind CSS operates by adding utility classes directly to HTML elements. Therefore, you would need to add the necessary classes to the child `div` elements directly.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Add your Tailwind CSS classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

If you want to apply styles conditionally or based on some logic, you might need to use JavaScript or a JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Angular in combination with Tailwind CSS.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides utility classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It doesn't provide a way to select elements using CSS selectors like `>`.

However, you can use the `@layer` directive in your CSS to define your own custom styles. Here's an example of how you can define a custom style to select the direct children of a `div` element with class `section`:

```css
@layer components {
  .section > * {
    /* Your styles here */
  }
}
```

This will select all direct children of a `div` element with class `section` and apply the styles you define inside the curly braces. You can then add the `section` class to your HTML element to apply this style:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
``` 

Note that this approach requires you to define your own custom styles, which may not be as flexible as using CSS selectors directly.

Response B is better [x] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
