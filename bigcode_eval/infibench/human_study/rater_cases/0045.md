Response A:



This error occurs because the version of Maven used by IntelliJ IDEA (Bundled) is older than the version used by your project. To resolve this issue, you can either:

1. Update the bundled Maven version in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Use a local Maven installation instead of the bundled one.

Here are the steps to update the bundled Maven version in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Build Tools` > `Maven`.
2. Uncheck the `Use bundled Maven` checkbox.
3. Browse and select the path to your local Maven installation.
4. Click `Apply` and then `OK`.

If you prefer to use a local Maven installation, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Maven on your system.
2. Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Build Tools` > `Maven`.
3. Uncheck the `Use bundled Maven` checkbox.
4. Browse and select the path to your local Maven installation.
5. Click `Apply` and then `OK`.

After completing these steps, the error should be resolved, and you should be able to import the project without any issues.

Response B:

The error you're seeing is due to a compatibility issue between the version of Maven bundled with IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven used in your project. 

The `NoSuchMethodError` exception is thrown when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) tries to call a specified method of a class (either static or instance), and that class no longer has a definition of that method. In your case, it seems that IntelliJ's Maven integration is trying to call a method on `DefaultModelValidator` that doesn't exist in the version of Maven used by your project.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains regularly releases updates for IntelliJ IDEA that often include fixes for compatibility issues like this one. Check if there's an update available for your version of IntelliJ IDEA.

2. **Change the Maven version in IntelliJ IDEA**: You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the same version of Maven as your project. Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven` and set the `Maven home directory` to the directory where your version of Maven is installed.

3. **Update the Maven version in your project**: If you have the flexibility to do so, consider updating the version of Maven used in your project to match the version bundled with IntelliJ IDEA.

4. **Disable the Maven bundled in IntelliJ IDEA**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try disabling the Maven bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. Go to `File > Settings > Plugins` and disable the `Maven Integration` plugin.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes to ensure they take effect.
