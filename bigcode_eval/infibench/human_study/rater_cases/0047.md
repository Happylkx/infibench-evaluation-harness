Response A:

No. 

The C++ standard does not provide a way to query or enforce the properties of threads related to their performance or the specific cores they run on. These are typically handled by the operating system and hardware, and are not directly exposed to the programmer through the C++ standard library. However, some operating systems may provide platform-specific APIs or libraries that allow for more fine-grained control over thread properties.

Response A is better [x] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



Yes, it is possible to distinguish between high- and low-performance cores/threads in C++, and it is also possible to query the properties of std::thread and enforce on which cores they'll run. However, the specific methods to do this can vary depending on the operating system and hardware.

To distinguish between high- and low-performance cores/threads, you can use platform-specific APIs or libraries. For example, on Linux, you can use the sched_getaffinity and sched_setaffinity functions to get and set the CPU affinity of a thread. This allows you to specify which cores a thread can run on, which can help you to distinguish between high- and low-performance cores.

To query the properties of std::thread, you can use the std::thread::get_id function to get the thread ID, and then use platform-specific APIs to query the properties of the thread. For example, on Linux, you can use the pthread_getaffinity_np function to get the CPU affinity of a thread.

To enforce on which cores a std::thread will run, you can use the sched_setaffinity function to set the CPU affinity of the thread. This allows you to specify which cores the thread can run on, which can help you to ensure that it runs on high-performance cores.

However, it's important to note that these methods are not portable and may not work on all operating systems or hardware. Additionally, using these methods to enforce the CPU affinity of a thread can have negative performance implications, as it can lead to thread contention and decreased parallelism.

Overall, while it is possible to distinguish between high- and low-performance cores/threads and to enforce on which cores a std::thread will run in C++, it is a complex and platform-specific task that should be approached with caution.
