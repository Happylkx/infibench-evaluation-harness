Case URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56611698

------
Response A:



The function should:

1. Extract the file ID from the URL.
2. Construct the new URL using the file ID.
3. Return the new URL.

The new URL should be in the format: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID`

Here is the function:

```python
def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    new_url = f'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id={file_id}'
    return new_url
```

You can use this function to get the right URL and then use `pd.read_csv(new_url)` to read the csv file.

```python
new_url = processURL(url)
df = pd.read_csv(new_url)
```

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL to get the direct download link. Here's how you can modify the URL:

1. Copy the file ID from the original URL. In this case, the file ID is `0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28`.
2. Replace the file ID in the following URL: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID`.
3. Use this modified URL to read the CSV file using pandas.

Here's the modified code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    csv_url = f'https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}'
    return csv_url

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
csv_url = processURL(url)
df = pd.read_csv(csv_url)
```

The `processURL` function takes the original URL as input and returns the modified URL. You can then use this modified URL to read the CSV file using pandas.

Response B is better [x] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
