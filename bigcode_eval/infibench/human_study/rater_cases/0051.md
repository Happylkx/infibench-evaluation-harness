Response A:

Sure, here is a bash script that installs a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of Python
brew unlink python

# Install the required version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current version of Python and link to Python 3.6.5. If you have other Python versions installed and linked, you may need to manage them accordingly.

```bash
# Install Python 3.6.5 using Homebrew
