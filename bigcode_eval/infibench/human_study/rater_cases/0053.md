Response A:

To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library. Here's the `writeToExcel` function that creates an Excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the contents of the `new_list` variable into the file:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function first creates a new workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method. It then selects the active worksheet using the `wb.active` property. The function then iterates over the `new_list` variable and appends each sublist as a row in the worksheet using the `sheet.append(row)` method. Finally, the function saves the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx" using the `wb.save("data.xlsx")` method.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write data to an Excel file. Here is the function you requested:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    # Write data to worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, selects the active worksheet, writes the data from `new_list` to the worksheet, and then saves the workbook as "data.xlsx". The `ws.cell()` method is used to write data to a specific cell, and the `row` and `column` parameters are used to specify the cell's location.

Note: The `openpyxl` library is not included in the standard Python library, so you may need to install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
