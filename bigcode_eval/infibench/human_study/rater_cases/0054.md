Response A:

Here is the declaration of `ClientInfo` struct in Go:

```go
type ClientInfo struct {
    Clients []struct {
        Hostname string `json:"Hostname"`
        IP string `json:"IP"`
        MacAddr string `json:"MacAddr"`
    } `json:"Clients"`
}
```

Note that we have used anonymous structs to define the `Clients` array. The `json` tags are used to specify the names of the fields in the JSON object.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

Sure, here is the `ClientInfo` struct that you can use:

```go
type ClientInfo struct {
	Hostname string `json:"Hostname"`
	IP       string `json:"IP"`
	MacAddr  string `json:"MacAddr"`
}

type Clients struct {
	Clients []ClientInfo `json:"Clients"`
}
```

In this code, `ClientInfo` is a struct that represents each client, and `Clients` is a struct that contains a slice of `ClientInfo`. The `json` tags are used to specify the key names in the JSON object.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
