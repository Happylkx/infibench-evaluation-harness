Response A:

Sure! Here's the revised code:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo').default;

...

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

client.connect((err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to MongoDB:', err);
    process.exit(1);
  }

  const db = client.db();

  app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ client, dbName: db.databaseName })
  }));
});
```

Note that `connect-mongo` v4 requires a `MongoClient` instance instead of a `mongoose` connection. We create a new `MongoClient` instance using the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable and pass it to `MongoStore.create()`. We also need to specify the name of the database using the `dbName` option. Finally, we wrap the `app.use()` call in a `client.connect()` callback to ensure that the session store is only used after the database connection has been established.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



Here's the updated code:

```javascript
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo')

...

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.MONGODB_URI })
}))
```

In `connect-mongo` v4, the constructor has been replaced with a `create` function. Also, the `mongooseConnection` option has been replaced with `mongoUrl`.

Response B is better [x] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
