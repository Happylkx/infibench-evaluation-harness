Response A:



Yes, I can help you with that. You're on the right track, but you need to define the type of the array elements separately and then use that type in the array definition. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
type Product = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
};

const bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
};
```

In this code, `Product` is a type that represents an object with `name`, `price`, and `description` properties of specific types. Then, `Product[]` is used to define the type of the `products` parameter as an array of `Product` objects.

Response A is better [x] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

Sure, you can define an inline type for the `products` parameter like this:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

This means `products` is an array of objects, where each object has a `name` property of type `string`, a `price` property of type `number`, and a `description` property of type `string`.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
