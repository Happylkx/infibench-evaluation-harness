------
Response A:

You should use the following command to rollback the migration:
```
bin/console doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

The reason why the previous commands did not work is that the migration class name is `Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642`, not just `20210909072642`. The `doctrine:migrations:execute` command expects the full class name of the migration to be passed as an argument.

By using the full class name, the command should be able to find the migration and execute the rollback successfully.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

The error message is indicating that the migration class `20210909072642` was not found. This is because you should use the full namespace of the migration class when executing the `doctrine:migrations:execute` command.

Based on the namespace you provided (`Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642`), you should use the following command:

```bash
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

This command tells Doctrine to execute the `down` method of the migration class `Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642`, which will rollback the changes made by this migration. The `-vvv` option is used to increase the verbosity of the output, and the `--no-interaction` option is used to prevent the command from asking any interactive question.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
