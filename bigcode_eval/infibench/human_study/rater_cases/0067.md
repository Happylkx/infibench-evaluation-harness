------
Response A:

To select the second column by name, you can use the `[[` operator with quotes around the column name:

```r
second_col <- d3[["a.1"]]
```

This will select the second column with name "a.1" and assign it to the variable `second_col`.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names, R will automatically make the column names unique by appending a suffix. In your case, the column names of `d3` will be `a` and `a.1`. 

You can select the second column by its name `a.1` like this:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

However, if for some reason the column names are not made unique and you still have two columns with the same name, you can select the second column by its index:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column regardless of its name.

Response B is better [x] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
