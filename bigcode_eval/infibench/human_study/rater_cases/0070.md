Response A:


You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here's how you can modify your code:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

In this code, `now()` will return the current date and time. This will automatically update the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in your database.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here is how you can modify your function to store the current date time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

The `now()` function will return the current date and time in the format `Y-m-d H:i:s`, which is the format MySQL uses for datetime fields.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
