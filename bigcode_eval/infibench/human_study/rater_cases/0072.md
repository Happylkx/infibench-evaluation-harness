Response A:

You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, this will apply them to your current terminal session.

Alternatively, you can use the `.` (dot) command which is equivalent to `source`:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

Both of these commands will work in macOS terminal and they will not close your current terminal window.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

In MacOS, you can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you have made to it. You should see the changes take effect immediately.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
