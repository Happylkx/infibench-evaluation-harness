Response A:

For the first question, the issue could be related to the session configuration on the host domain. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the session storage path is writable by the web server user.
2. Check if the session cookie domain is set correctly in the .env file. It should be set to the domain name of your website.
3. Check if the session cookie path is set correctly in the .env file. It should be set to the root path of your website.
4. Check if the session cookie name is set correctly in the .env file. It should be set to a unique name for your application.
5. Check if the session driver is set correctly in the .env file. It should be set to the same driver that you are using locally.

For the second question, the error message suggests that there is an issue with the SSL certificate. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the SSL certificate is valid and not expired.
2. Check if the SSL certificate is installed correctly on the server.
3. Check if the SSL certificate is trusted by the client's email server.
4. Try changing the encryption method to TLS instead of SSL in the .env file and mail.php file.
5. Try using port 465 instead of 587 in the .env file and mail.php file.

Response B:

For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be due to several reasons:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. This is where the index.php file resides.

2. **Session Configuration**: Check your session configuration in the `config/session.php` file. Ensure that the `domain` option is correctly set. If your application is on a subdomain like `sub.example.com`, then your domain should be `.example.com`.

3. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your cookie configuration in the `config/session.php` file. Ensure that the `secure` option is set to `true` if you are using HTTPS, otherwise set it to `false`.

4. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

For the second issue, the error message "SSL operation failed with code 1" suggests that there's an issue with the SSL configuration. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change MAIL_ENCRYPTION**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` from `ssl` to `tls` in your `.env` file.

2. **Change MAIL_PORT**: The port 587 is typically used with `tls`. If you're using `ssl`, the port should be 465. So, try changing `MAIL_PORT` from 587 to 465 in your `.env` file.

3. **Check with the Email Provider**: There might be some specific settings required by the email provider. Check with them if there are any specific settings that you need to use.

Remember to clear the configuration cache using `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to the `.env` file.
