Response A:

C++ does not have built-in string interpolation like C# or JavaScript. However, you can use `std::stringstream` or `std::to_string` for similar functionality.

Here's an example using `std::stringstream`:

```cpp
#include <sstream>

int myVariable = 5;
std::stringstream ss;
ss << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
std::string result = ss.str();
```

And here's an example using `std::to_string`:

```cpp
int myVariable = 5;
std::string result = "My variable has value " + std::to_string(myVariable);
```

If you want more advanced string formatting, you might want to consider using a library like `fmt` (https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html) or `boost::format`.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



C++ does not have built-in string interpolation like C# or JavaScript. However, you can achieve a similar effect using the `std::ostringstream` class. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int myVariable = 10;
std::ostringstream oss;
oss << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
std::string result = oss.str();
```

In this example, `oss` is an object of `std::ostringstream`. We use the `<<` operator to insert the string and the variable into the stream. Finally, we use the `str()` function to get the final string from the stream.

This is not as concise as the C# or JavaScript examples, but it's a common way to achieve string interpolation in C++.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [x] (label [x]) to select
