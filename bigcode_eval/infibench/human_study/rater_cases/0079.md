Response A:

You can use the `merge` function in pandas to merge the two data frames on all columns and then use the `indicator` parameter to filter out the rows that are present in both data frames. Here's the code for the `getDifference` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def getDifference(df1, df2):
    merged = pd.merge(df1, df2, how='outer', indicator=True)
    return merged[merged['_merge'] == 'left_only'].drop('_merge', axis=1)
```

Here, we first merge the two data frames using the `outer` join and set the `indicator` parameter to `True`. This adds a new column `_merge` to the merged data frame which indicates whether a row is present in both data frames (`both`), only in the left data frame (`left_only`), or only in the right data frame (`right_only`).

We then filter out the rows that are present only in the left data frame (`left_only`) and drop the `_merge` column from the resulting data frame.

You can call this function with your data frames `df1` and `df2` like this:

```python
df3 = getDifference(df1, df2)
```

This will return a new data frame `df3` which has all the rows/columns in `df1` that are not in `df2`.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



Here is the Python code for the function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def getDifference(df1, df2):
    df3 = pd.concat([df1, df2]).drop_duplicates(keep=False)
    return df3
```

This function works by concatenating `df1` and `df2`, then dropping the duplicates. The `keep=False` argument ensures that only the rows that are not duplicated in both data frames are kept.

Please note that this function assumes that the data frames have the same columns. If they don't, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [x] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
