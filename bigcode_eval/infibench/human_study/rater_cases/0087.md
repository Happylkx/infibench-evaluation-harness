Response A:

You can try using the `tz_localize` method to set the timezone to UTC and then use `tz_convert` to convert it to a timezone-unaware datetime object. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None).dt.tz_convert('UTC').dt.tz_localize(None)
```

This will remove the timezone information from the "time" column and convert it to a timezone-unaware datetime object. You can then pass this modified DataFrame to the `to_excel` method.

Here's the complete `removeTimezone` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def removeTimezone(df):
    df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None).dt.tz_convert('UTC').dt.tz_localize(None)
    return df
```

You can call this function with your DataFrame as the argument and it will return the modified DataFrame with the timezone information removed from the "time" column.

Response A is better [x] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

Here is a function that should remove the timezone from a datetime column in your DataFrame:

```python
def removeTimezone(df):
    for col in df.columns:
        if df[col].dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]':
            df[col] = df[col].dt.tz_convert(None)
    return df
```

This function iterates over each column in the DataFrame. If the column's data type is 'datetime64[ns, UTC]', it converts the timezone to None, effectively removing the timezone. 

You can use this function before writing your DataFrame to Excel:

```python
df = removeTimezone(df)
df.to_excel(writer, header = True, index = True)
```

Please note that this function assumes that the column with the timezone is of type 'datetime64[ns, UTC]'. If the column has a different type, you may need to adjust the condition in the if statement.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
