Response A:

The error message you're seeing is from rust-analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's used by many editors (like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) to provide features like code completion, navigation, and error checking.

The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is a bit cryptic, but it's essentially saying that rust-analyzer is having trouble understanding some macro-related code. In this case, it's likely having trouble with the `assert_eq!` macro in your test.

This is a known issue with rust-analyzer. It sometimes has trouble with macros, especially in more complex scenarios. It's an area of active development and improvement.

The good news is that this error is not something you need to fix in your code. If your code compiles correctly with `cargo build` and `cargo test`, then it's correct. The error from rust-analyzer is more of a false positive.

You can try to update rust-analyzer to the latest version, as improvements are being made constantly. If the error persists, you can choose to ignore it, or you can report it to the rust-analyzer team on their GitHub page as a potential bug.

Response B:



The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" indicates that the Rust Analyzer tool is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro. This macro is used to create a `std::fmt::Arguments` value, which is then used for formatting strings.

The error might be caused by a few reasons:

1. The `format_args` macro is not in scope. Make sure that you have imported it correctly, and that it is available in the current scope.

2. There might be a problem with the Rust Analyzer tool itself. Try restarting it or updating it to the latest version.

3. The error might be caused by a bug in the Rust Analyzer tool. If you're sure that your code is correct, you can ignore the error. However, it's a good idea to report the issue to the Rust Analyzer team so that they can investigate it further.

In your case, the `format_args` macro is not used explicitly in the code you provided. However, it's used implicitly by the `assert_eq!` macro. If the error is not caused by a problem with the Rust Analyzer tool, it might be caused by a problem with the `assert_eq!` macro itself. Try replacing the `assert_eq!` macro with a simple `assert!` macro to see if the error persists. If it does, then the problem is not with the `assert_eq!` macro. If it doesn't, then the problem is with the `assert_eq!` macro.

Here's how you can modify your test to use a simple `assert!` macro:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::get_padded_row;

    #[test]
    fn row_padding_dashes() {
        let padded_row = get_padded_row("hello", 15, Some('-'));
        assert!(
            padded_row == "-----hello-----".to_string(),
            "`get_padded_row` was not correct, got `{}`", padded_row
        );
    }
}
```

If the error persists, then it's likely a problem with the Rust Analyzer tool. In that case, you can ignore the error, or you can report the issue to the Rust Analyzer team.
