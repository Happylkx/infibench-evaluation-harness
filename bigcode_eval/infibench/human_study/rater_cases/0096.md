------
Response A:

GitLab CI/CD doesn't support nested variable expansion in the `variables` section of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This is a limitation of GitLab CI/CD, not the Bash shell.

In your case, the `${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` expression is not evaluated as you might expect in a Bash shell. Instead, GitLab CI/CD tries to find a variable named `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH` and, not finding it, it returns `}` as the value.

To work around this limitation, you can use a script to perform the variable expansion:

```yaml
job1:
  script:
    - |
      GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}"
      echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

In this case, the variable expansion is performed by the Bash shell, not GitLab CI/CD, so it works as expected.

Response A is better [x] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

This issue is caused by a bug in GitLab CI/CD's YAML parsing. The nested parameter expansion syntax is not supported in GitLab CI/CD. As a workaround, you can use a script block to perform the variable expansion instead of defining the variable directly in the `variables` section. Here's an example:

```
job1:
  script:
    - GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}"
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
