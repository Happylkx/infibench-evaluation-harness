Response A:



The issue you're experiencing might be due to a known bug in Safari where the `height: auto` property doesn't work correctly within a flex container.

To fix this issue, you can try adding `align-items: flex-start;` to the `.container section:first-child` rule. This should ensure that the image doesn't stretch vertically.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```

This should make the `height: auto` property work correctly in Safari.

Response A is better [x] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

In Safari, when an image is in a nested flexbox element with a width set and height: auto, it may not work as expected. To fix this issue, you can try adding `align-self: flex-start;` to the image element. This will align the image to the top of the flexbox container and allow the `height: auto` property to work properly.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start;
}
```

This should fix the issue and allow the images to be displayed with the correct aspect ratio in Safari.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
