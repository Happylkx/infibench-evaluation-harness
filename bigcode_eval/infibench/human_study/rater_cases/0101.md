Response A:

The Docker `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions do not source the `~/.bashrc` file when they run. This is because they do not run their commands in an interactive shell, and `~/.bashrc` is only sourced by interactive shells.

You can work around this by explicitly sourcing `~/.bashrc` in your `launch.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source $HOME/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Or, you can use the `bash -c` command to run your script in an interactive shell:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "/workspace/launch.sh"]
```

Either way, this will ensure that `~/.bashrc` is sourced before your script runs, so `nvm` and your Node.js environment will be properly set up.

Response B:


The `~/.bashrc` is not sourced automatically when a Docker container is started. This is because Docker containers typically run with a non-interactive shell, which does not source `~/.bashrc` by default.

To source `~/.bashrc` in your Docker container, you can modify your `launch.sh` script to source `~/.bashrc` before running your commands. Here's how you can modify your `launch.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source the .bashrc file
source ~/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Now, when you run your Docker container, `~/.bashrc` will be sourced, and the `node` and `npm` commands should be available.
