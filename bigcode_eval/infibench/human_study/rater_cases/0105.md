Response A:

```javascript
const { data: userBio } = userFulfilled ? useGetUserBioQuery(user.id) : null;
```

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` variable. Once it becomes true, you can then run the second query.

Here's the code for the second query:

```javascript
const [userBio, setUserBio] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled && user) {
    const { data } = await useGetUserBioQuery(user.id);
    setUserBio(data);
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user]);
```

This code uses the `useState` hook to create a `userBio` state variable and the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in `userFulfilled` and `user`. Once both are fulfilled, it runs the second query and sets the `userBio` state variable to the returned data.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
