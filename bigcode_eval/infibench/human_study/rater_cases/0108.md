Response A:



You can target the accordion arrow by using the `::after` pseudo-element selector. Here's how you can change the color of the arrow to green:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 16 16' fill='%2328a745'%3e%3cpath fill-rule='evenodd' d='M1.646 4.646a.5.5 0 0 1 .708 0L8 10.293l5.646-5.647a.5.5 0 0 1 .708.708l-6 6a.5.5 0 0 1-.708 0l-6-6a.5.5 0 0 1 0-.708z'/%3e%3c/svg%3e");
}
```

In this CSS, we're using a data URL to create an SVG image of the arrow. The `fill` attribute in the SVG code is set to `#28a745`, which is the hex code for green. Replace `#28a745` with your desired green color code if it's different.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after` pseudo-element and setting its `border-color` property to green. Here's the CSS code you can add to your stylesheet:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    border-color: green;
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green when the accordion is expanded. If you want to change the color of the arrow when the accordion is collapsed, you can add the following CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    border-color: green;
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green when the accordion is collapsed.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
