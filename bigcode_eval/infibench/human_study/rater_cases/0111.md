------
Response A:

You can use the `add` and `subtract` methods.
Also you can use `DateTime` to define the base time and change the day/month/`year` properties.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

You can use the `add` and `subtract` methods of the `DateTime` class in Dart to add or subtract months/years to a date. 

To add/subtract months/years to a `DateTime` object, you can use the `add` and `subtract` methods with a `Duration` object. For example, to add 3 months to a `DateTime` object `date`, you can use the following code:

```
DateTime newDate = date.add(Duration(days: 3 * 30));
```

Similarly, to subtract 2 years from a `DateTime` object `date`, you can use the following code:

```
DateTime newDate = date.subtract(Duration(days: 2 * 365));
```

Alternatively, you can use the `DateTime` constructor to define the base time and change the day/month/year properties. For example, to add 2 years to a `DateTime` object `date`, you can use the following code:

```
DateTime newDate = DateTime(date.year + 2, date.month, date.day);
```

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
