Response A:

You can use the go command:
```bash
go test -count=1
```
The `-count=1` flag forces `go test` to always run tests and not to cache test results.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:


You can use the go command:
```bash
go test -count=1
```

The `-count=1` flag tells Go to run each test once, regardless of whether it has been run before and the results are cached.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
