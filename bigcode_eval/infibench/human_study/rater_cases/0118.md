Response A:

Sure, you can use the `keydown` event to listen for the "enter" key. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
import { Editor, StarterKit } from '@tiptap/vue-2'
import { Keymap } from '@tiptap/core'
import { defaultKeymap } from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'

mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        ...defaultKeymap,
        'Enter': () => {
          console.log("good");
          return true;
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, we're using the `Keymap` extension from `@tiptap/core` to listen for the "Enter" key. When the "Enter" key is pressed, it will execute `console.log("good")`.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

Sure! Here is the revised code that listens for the "enter" key and executes `console.log("good")`:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit.configure({
        onKeyDown: (props, editor, next) => {
          if (props.event.keyCode === 13) {
            console.log("good");
            // submit chat and clear editor here
          } else {
            next();
          }
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

This code uses the `configure` method of the `StarterKit` extension to add an `onKeyDown` event listener. The event listener checks if the key code of the pressed key is 13 (which is the code for the "enter" key), and if it is, it executes `console.log("good")`. You can replace the `console.log("good")` line with your own code to submit the chat and clear the editor.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
