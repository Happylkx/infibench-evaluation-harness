Response A:

Here is the function `getASCIIAsString` in Go:

```go
func getASCIIAsString(asciiCode byte) string {
    return string(asciiCode)
}
```

This function takes a byte (which is equivalent to an ASCII code) as an argument and converts it to a string using the built-in `string` function in Go. The resulting string is then returned.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

```go
func getASCIIAsString(asciiCode byte) string {
    return string(asciiCode)
}
```

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
