Response A:



The refactored code should be filled in the blank between the start and end comments.

The refactored code should be:

```javascript
const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => props.isSelected ? 'white' : 'black'};
  background-color: ${props => props.isSelected ? 'black' : '#C4C4C4'};
  cursor: ${props => props.isSelected ? 'default' : 'pointer'};
`
```

The refactored code moves the `TabWrapper` component outside of the `Tab` component to avoid unnecessary re-rendering. This improves the efficiency of the code.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

The problem with your code is that you're defining the `TabWrapper` styled component inside your `Tab` component. This means that a new `TabWrapper` is created every time the `Tab` component is rendered, which is inefficient.

Instead, you should define `TabWrapper` outside of the `Tab` component. You can still use props in your styled component by passing them in as arguments to a function. Here's how you can refactor your code:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

// start
const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
  background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
  cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`
// end

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
  return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this refactored code, `TabWrapper` is only created once, and the `isSelected` prop is passed to it in the `Tab` component's render method. This is more efficient and follows best practices for using styled-components in React.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
