------
Response A:

You can achieve this by using the `border-t` class to apply the border to the top only. You should also remove the `border` class to avoid applying borders to all sides. Here is the corrected code:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will apply a border only to the top of the div and the border color will be blue-900.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

To have the line drawn only to the top, you can use the `border-t` class instead of `border`. The `border-t` class applies a border only to the top of the element. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900 border-1">foo</div>
```

This will apply a 1 pixel thick blue border only to the top of the element. You can adjust the thickness of the border by changing the `border-1` class to `border-2`, `border-4`, etc.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
