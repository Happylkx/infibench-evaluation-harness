Response A:

As of now, Enzyme does not have an official adapter for React 17. However, you can use the adapter for React 16 with React 17 without any issues. 

Here is the updated code snippet with the adapter for React 16:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that we are using the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package instead of the `enzyme-adapter-react-16` package. This adapter is a community-maintained adapter that works with React 17.

With this adapter, you can write unit tests for your React 17 app using Enzyme.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



Unfortunately, Enzyme does not officially support React 17 yet. However, you can use the React 16 adapter with React 17 as it is backward compatible. The React 16 adapter should work fine with React 17 because the breaking changes in React 17 are mostly related to concurrent mode and hooks, which Enzyme does not use.

So, the code snippet you provided should work with React 17 without any modifications. You can continue using the `enzyme-adapter-react-16` adapter with React 17 as it is.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
