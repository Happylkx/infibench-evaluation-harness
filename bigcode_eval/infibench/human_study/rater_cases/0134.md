------
Response A:

TypeScript is ignoring `index.d.ts` because it assumes that it is generated from `index.tsx`, which is more likely to be up to date. Name your `index.d.ts` file something else, e.g., `declaration.d.ts`.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:



TypeScript is ignoring `.d.ts` files because it assumes that they are generated from `.ts` files, which are more likely to be up to date. Name your `.d.ts` file something else, e.g., `declaration.d.ts`.

This is the correct solution. By renaming the `.d.ts` file to `declaration.d.ts`, TypeScript will no longer ignore it and will correctly recognize the image module.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
