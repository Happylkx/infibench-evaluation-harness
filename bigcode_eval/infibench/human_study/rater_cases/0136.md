Response A:

The issue is with the format of your `$theme-colors` map. You need to specify the color values in a valid CSS format. Here's an example of how you can define your `$theme-colors` map:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd,
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";

$theme-colors-rgb: map-loop($theme-colors, to-rgb, "$value") !default;
$theme-colors-contrast: map-loop($theme-colors, color-contrast, "$value") !default;

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this example, the color values are specified in a valid CSS format (i.e. `#0d6efd` instead of just `0d6efd`). 

Also, make sure to import the necessary Bootstrap functions, variables, and mixins before importing the Bootstrap styles.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

The error message you're seeing is because the `map-loop` function is not a built-in Sass function, and it's not defined anywhere in your code or in Bootstrap's code.

In Bootstrap 5, you should be able to override the `$theme-colors` map directly. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color-here` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color.

Please note that you need to import the `functions.scss` file before the `variables.scss` file. This is because the `variables.scss` file uses functions defined in the `functions.scss` file.

Also, you need to define all the colors in the `$theme-colors` map, not just the one you want to change. If you only define the "primary" color, for example, the other colors will be undefined and you'll get errors when you try to compile your Sass code.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
