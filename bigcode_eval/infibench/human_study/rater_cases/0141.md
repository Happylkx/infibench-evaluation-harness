Response A:

You can use `ElevatedButton`, `TextButton` and `OutlinedButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which placed in the `ButtonStyle` property. Set the `shape` property to `RoundedRectangleBorder` and set the `borderRadius` property to the desired value. Here's an example:

```
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  child: Text('Button'),
  style: ButtonStyle(
    shape: MaterialStateProperty.all<RoundedRectangleBorder>(
      RoundedRectangleBorder(
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(18.0),
      ),
    ),
  ),
),
```

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



Here is the solution:

You can use the `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, or `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `style` property which is placed in the `ButtonStyle` property.

To create a rounded button with a border-radius in Flutter, you can use the `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, or `TextButton` and change the `shape` property which is placed in the `ButtonStyle` property. Here's an example:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Your code here
  },
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0),
    ),
  ),
  child: Text('Your Button Text'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used, but you can replace it with `OutlinedButton` or `TextButton` as per your requirement. The `BorderRadius.circular(10.0)` is used to create a rounded button with a border-radius of 10.0. You can adjust the value as per your design.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
