Response A:



You can use the following code to filter the data for 'PASS TEST' and then group it by 'TEST_TYPE':

```python
pass_tests = data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
grouped_pass_tests = pass_tests.groupby('TEST_TYPE').size()
```

In this code, `data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']` is used to filter the data for rows where 'TEST_STATUS' is 'PASS TEST'. Then, `groupby('TEST_TYPE').size()` is used to group the filtered data by 'TEST_TYPE' and count the number of occurrences of each 'TEST_TYPE'.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

To filter the data by `TEST_STATUS` column where the value is "PASS TEST", you can use the `loc` function in pandas. Here's an example code:

```python
pass_test_data = data_useless.loc[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
```

This will create a new dataframe `pass_test_data` that contains only the rows where `TEST_STATUS` is "PASS TEST".

If you want to group the data by `TEST_STATUS` and count the values for each group, you can use the following code:

```python
data_useless.groupby('TEST_STATUS').count()
```

This will group the data by `TEST_STATUS` and count the number of rows for each group.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
