Response A:



The problem is that you're trying to inject an `ILogger` into your `MyClass` but you haven't registered it with your dependency injection container.

You can solve this problem by registering `MyClass` with the service collection and specifying that it depends on `ILogger<MyClass>`. Here's how you can modify your code:

```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>() // Register MyClass
    .BuildServiceProvider();

var myClass = services.GetService<MyClass>(); // Get an instance of MyClass
myClass.MyFunc();
```

Then, modify your `MyClass` constructor to accept `ILogger<MyClass>` instead of `ILogger`:

```c#
private readonly ILogger<MyClass> _logger;

public MyClass(ILogger<MyClass> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}
```

This way, the dependency injection framework will be able to provide an `ILogger<MyClass>` instance when it creates `MyClass`.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

The problem is that you're trying to inject `ILogger` directly, but the logging services are added as `ILogger<TCategoryName>`. You should change your class to accept `ILogger<MyClass>` instead. Here's how:

```c#
private readonly ILogger<MyClass> _logger;

public MyClass(ILogger<MyClass> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}

public void MyFunc()
{
    _logger.Log(LogLevel.Error, "My Message");
}
```

This way, the dependency injection container can resolve the logger instance correctly.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
