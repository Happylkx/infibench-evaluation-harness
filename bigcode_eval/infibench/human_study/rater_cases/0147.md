Response A:

You need to call the `toast` method on the jQuery object to show the toast. Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast when a specific event happens (like clicking a button), you can put this code inside an event handler.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap and jQuery libraries in your HTML file. Here is an example of how to include them:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Please replace the version numbers with the ones you are using.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



You need to initialize the toast using the `toast` method provided by Bootstrap. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, you can use the `show` method in the event handler. For example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function () {
    $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

In this case, the toast will be shown when the button with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)
