Response A:



The err113 linter is suggesting that you should not define dynamic errors using `errors.New()` in your Go code. Instead, it recommends using wrapped static errors. This can improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

To fix this, you can define your errors as constants at the top of your file and then use those constants when you need to return an error. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:

```go
package yourpackage

import (
	"errors"
)

var (
	ErrRepoSave    = errors.New("error occurred while saving to repo")
	ErrRepoFindAll = errors.New("error occurred while finding all in repo")
)

// ... rest of your code ...

func YourFunction() ([]Foo, error) {
	// ...
	return nil, ErrRepoFindAll
}

func AnotherFunction(bar *Bar) error {
	// ...
	return ErrRepoSave
}
```

In your tests, you can then use these errors in your expectations:

```go
repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrRepoFindAll)
repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepoSave)
```

This way, you're following the best practice of using static errors and improving the readability of your code.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

The `err113` linter is complaining because you're creating new error instances in your code with `errors.New()`. This is considered a bad practice because it makes it harder to check for specific errors. Instead, you should define your errors as package-level variables and use those in your code. This way, you can use `errors.Is()` to check for specific errors.

Here's how you can fix your code:

```go
var (
    ErrRepoGave = errors.New("repo gave err")
    ErrOops = errors.New("oops")
)

// ...

func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
    // ...
    repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepoGave)
    // ...
    repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
    // ...
}
```

Now, instead of creating new errors each time, you're using the same error instances. This allows you to compare errors with `errors.Is()`, like so:

```go
err := someFunctionThatMightReturnAnError()
if errors.Is(err, ErrRepoGave) {
    // handle the error
}
```

This is a more robust way of handling errors, because it doesn't rely on the error message being exactly the same every time. Instead, it checks if the error is the same instance, which is more reliable.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
