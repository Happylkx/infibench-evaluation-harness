------
Response A:

The reason it didn't work is that this needs to be done inside a function, not at the top level.
Another solution is to declare your map in Flutter with the keyword "final".

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:



The correct code would be:
```dart
void main() {
  Map<String, int> someMap = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
  };

  someMap["c"] = 3;
}
```
Or:
```dart
final Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

someMap["c"] = 3;
```

The reason it didn't work is that this needs to be done inside a `main` function`, not at the top level. Another solution is to declare your map in Dart with the keyword `final`. The correct code would be:

```dart
void main() {
  Map<String, int> someMap = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
  };

  someMap["c"] = 3;
}
```

Or:

```dart
final Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

someMap["c"] = 3;
```

In Dart, you can't declare variables at the top level outside of a function. To fix the errors, you need to either place the code inside a `main` function or declare the map with the `final` keyword.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
