Response A:



```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T', bound='M')

class M(Generic[T]):
    def set_width(self: T, width: int) -> T:
        self.width = width
        return self

    def set_height(self: T, height: int) -> T:
        self.height = height
        return self

class M3D(M['M3D']):
    def set_depth(self, depth: int) -> M3D:
        self.depth = depth
        return self
```

In this solution, we use Python's generic type hinting to allow each method to return an instance of the class it is called on. This allows method chaining to work correctly even in subclasses.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

Here are the modified classes `M` and `M3D`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T', bound='M')

class M(Generic[T]):
    def set_width(self: T, width: int) -> T:
        self.width = width
        return self

    def set_height(self: T, height: int) -> T:
        self.height = height
        return self


class M3D(M[M3D]):
    def set_depth(self, depth: int) -> M3D:
        self.depth = depth
        return self
```

The key change is to make `M` a generic class with a type parameter `T` that is bound to `M` (i.e., `T` must be a subclass of `M`). Then, we use `T` as the return type of the `set_width()` and `set_height()` methods, which allows these methods to return an instance of the subclass `M3D` when called on an instance of `M3D`.

In `M3D`, we specify that it is a subclass of `M[M3D]`, which means that `M3D` inherits all the methods of `M`, but with `T` set to `M3D`. This allows `set_width()` and `set_height()` to return an instance of `M3D` when called on an instance of `M3D`. Finally, we define `set_depth()` as a method of `M3D` that returns an instance of `M3D`.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
