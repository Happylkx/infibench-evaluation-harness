Response A:

The error occurs because the "year" column contains a value in float format ('2021.0') which cannot be converted to an integer using the `int()` function. To solve this issue, we need to remove the decimal part of the float value before converting it to an integer.

Here is the updated code to transform the "year" column from object to int:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).apply(lambda x: x.split('.')[0]).astype(int)
```

This code first converts the "year" column to a string, then splits the string at the decimal point and keeps only the integer part, and finally converts the result to an integer.

Here is the complete `transformation` function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).apply(lambda x: x.split('.')[0]).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function takes the `data_h_df` dataframe as input, applies the transformation to the "year" column, and returns the updated dataframe.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

The error you're encountering is because the 'year' column contains float values in string format. When you try to convert it directly to int, Python is unable to handle the decimal part, hence the ValueError.

You can solve this by first converting the column to float, then to int. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to float, which can handle the decimal part, then converts it to int, effectively truncating the decimal part.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
