Response A:

No

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:


Yes, it is still a vulnerability in major browsers after 2021. The `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is used to prevent the new page from being able to access the `window.opener` property and thus isolate it from the opening page, which can help mitigate the tab nabbing vulnerability. However, it does not address other potential security risks associated with using `target="_blank"`. For example, it does not prevent the new page from modifying the referrer header, which can leak sensitive information about the opening page. Therefore, it is still recommended to use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` whenever `target="_blank"` is used to open a link in a new window.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
