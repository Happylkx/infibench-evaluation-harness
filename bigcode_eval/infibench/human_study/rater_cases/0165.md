------
Response A:


The error message is indicating that you're trying to send a JSON body with a content type of "application/json", but the `post` method you're using doesn't support this directly.

To fix this, you can encode your body as a JSON string before sending it. Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert'; // Import the convert library

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

var body = {
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
};

var response = await post(
  Urls.getToken,
  headers: headers,
  body: jsonEncode(body), // Encode the body as a JSON string
);
```

By using `jsonEncode(body)`, you're converting the Dart Map into a JSON string, which can then be sent in the body of the request.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

The error message is indicating that you're trying to send a JSON body with the `http.post` method, but you're passing the body as a Map, not as a JSON string. 

The `http.post` method doesn't automatically encode the body to JSON. You need to do this manually using `json.encode`.

Here's how you can fix it:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

var body = json.encode({
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
});

var response = await post(
  Urls.getToken,
  headers: headers,
  body: body,
);
```

In this code, `json.encode` is used to convert the Map to a JSON string. This JSON string is then passed to the `http.post` method as the body.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
