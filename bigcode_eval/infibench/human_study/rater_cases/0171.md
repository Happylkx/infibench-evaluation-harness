Response A:

Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:].lower()
        startString = word[0].upper()
        pig_latin_words.append(endString + startString + 'ay')
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

The main changes are:

- Instead of returning a single word, we append each pig Latin word to a list `pig_latin_words`.
- We split the word into two parts: the end string (everything after the first letter) and the start string (the first letter). We convert the end string to lowercase and the start string to uppercase.
- We append the end string, start string, and "ay" to create the pig Latin word.
- Finally, we join all the pig Latin words with spaces and return the resulting string.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

Sure, here is the revised version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        result.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(result)
```

In your original code, you were returning the result inside the loop, which means the function would stop after processing the first word. I've changed it to append each processed word to a list, and then join them together into a single string at the end.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
