Response A:

The problem with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each character of the input string is in the `correct` string. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all()` function to check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string. If they are, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you should check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)

# Example usage:
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

In this code, the `checkString` function takes a string `text` as input and returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (i.e., in the `correct` string), and `False` otherwise.

You can call this function with any string as input, like this:

```python
if checkString("abc123"):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This will print "Success" because the string "abc123" contains only alphanumeric characters.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
