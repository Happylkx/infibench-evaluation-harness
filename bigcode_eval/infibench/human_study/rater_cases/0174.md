Response A:

The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the `zip` extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the `zip` extension is already installed, you should see it in the output. If not, you need to install it.

2. Install the `zip` extension on your server. The installation process depends on your server's operating system and PHP version. Here are some examples:

   - Ubuntu with PHP 7.4:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
     ```

   - CentOS with PHP 7.4:

     ```
     sudo yum install php74-php-zip
     ```

   - macOS with PHP 7.4 (using Homebrew):

     ```
     brew install php@7.4
     brew install php@7.4-zip
     ```

3. After installing the `zip` extension, restart your web server or PHP-FPM service to apply the changes.

   - Ubuntu with Apache:

     ```
     sudo systemctl restart apache2
     ```

   - CentOS with Apache:

     ```
     sudo systemctl restart httpd
     ```

   - Ubuntu with Nginx and PHP-FPM:

     ```
     sudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

   - CentOS with Nginx and PHP-FPM:

     ```
     sudo systemctl restart php74-php-fpm
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

After installing the `zip` extension on your server, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.

Response B:

The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You cannot install it via Composer. 

You need to install it via your PHP installation. The process of installing PHP extensions depends on your operating system.

Here are the general steps for some common operating systems:

**For Ubuntu/Debian**

You can install it via `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS/RHEL**

You can install it via `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum install php-zip
```

**For Windows**

You need to enable it in your `php.ini` file:

1. Find your `php.ini` file (you can check the location by running `php --ini`).
2. Open the `php.ini` file in a text editor.
3. Find the line `;extension=zip`.
4. Uncomment it by removing the semicolon (`;`), so it becomes `extension=zip`.
5. Save the `php.ini` file.
6. Restart your web server.

**For MacOS**

You can install it via `pecl`:

```bash
pecl install zip
```

After installing the extension, you may need to restart your web server or PHP-FPM service for the changes to take effect.

Then, in your `composer.json` file, you can specify that your project requires the `ext-zip` extension like this:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // ...
},
```

This won't install the extension, but when someone tries to install your project via Composer, they will get a warning if they don't have the `ext-zip` extension installed.
