Response A:

Sure, the issue with your code is that TypeScript does not allow you to use multiple index signatures in a single type. You can solve this by creating two separate types and then merging them using intersection (`&`).

Here is the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type `FruitsAndColors` where each fruit is associated with a number and each color is associated with a boolean.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

Sure! The correct definition of `FruitsAndColors` would be:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This uses the intersection operator (`&`) to combine two separate mapped types, one for the fruits and one for the colors.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
