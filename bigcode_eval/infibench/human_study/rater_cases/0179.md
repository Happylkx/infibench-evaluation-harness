------
Response A:

You can use the `--output` parameter to specify the output format as `text` and then pipe the output to `/dev/null` to discard it. This will prevent the interactive pager from opening up and allow the `for` loop to continue to the next iteration without any manual intervention.

Here's the modified script:

```
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo --output text >/dev/null; 
done
```

This will send the output to `/dev/null` instead of displaying it on the screen.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

You can disable the pager by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. This can be done in two ways:

1. **For a single command:**

```bash
AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo
```

2. **For all commands in the current shell session:**

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

After setting this, you can run your script:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will prevent the pager from being used for the output of AWS CLI commands.

If you want to make this change permanent, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash, `~/.zshrc` for zsh).

If you want to pipe the return values into a separate file, you can use the `>` operator:

```bash
aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt
```

This will redirect the standard output to a file named `output.txt`. If you want to append the output to the file instead of overwriting it each time, you can use `>>` instead of `>`.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
