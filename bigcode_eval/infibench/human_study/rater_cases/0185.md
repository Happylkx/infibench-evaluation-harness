Response A:

The error message indicates that the `libffi.so.6` library is missing. You can try installing it using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi6
```

If the library is already installed, you can try creating a symbolic link to it using the following command:

```
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6
```

This creates a symbolic link from `libffi.so.6` to `libffi.so.7`, which should resolve the issue.

If neither of these solutions work, you may need to reinstall Ruby and/or Rails to ensure that all dependencies are properly installed.

Response B:


 It seems like the `libffi` library is missing or outdated on your system. You can try to install or upgrade it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

After installing or upgrading the library, you might need to reinstall the `ffi` gem. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

This should resolve the issue you're experiencing. If the problem persists, you might want to consider reinstalling Ruby and all the gems in your project.
