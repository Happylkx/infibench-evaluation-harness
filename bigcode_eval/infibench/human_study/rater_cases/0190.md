Response A:

You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and the `pip` module to get the latest version available on PyPI. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import pkg_resources
import xmlrpc.client

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    pypi = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('https://pypi.org/pypi')
    available = pypi.package_releases(pkgName)
    if not available:  # package not found
        return False
    available = available[0]  # get the latest version available

    try:
        installed = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version
    except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:  # package is not installed
        return False

    return installed == available
```

This function returns `True` if the package is installed and its version is the latest available, and `False` otherwise.

Please note that this function may not work correctly if the package uses a non-standard versioning scheme. Also, it does not take into account pre-releases and development versions.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

You can use the `pip` package to check if a package is at its latest version. Here's an implementation of the `checkVersion` function in Python:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the package information
    package_info = pip.get_installed_distributions()
    for package in package_info:
        # Check if the package name matches
        if package.key == pkgName.lower():
            # Check if the package is up-to-date
            latest_version = pip.get_latest_version(pkgName)
            if package.version == latest_version:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    # If the package is not installed, return False
    return False
```

This function first gets the information of all installed packages using `pip.get_installed_distributions()`. It then loops through the packages to find the one with the matching name. If the package is found, it uses `pip.get_latest_version(pkgName)` to get the latest version of the package. If the installed version matches the latest version, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. If the package is not installed, the function also returns `False`.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
