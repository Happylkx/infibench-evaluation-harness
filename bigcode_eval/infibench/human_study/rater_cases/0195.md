Response A:


You can use a more robust method to extract the language code using regular expressions (regex). This method will work regardless of the format of the `lang` attribute. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+'
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+'
```

In this command, `-oP` tells `grep` to use Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) and to output only the matched part of the line. The regular expression `'lang="\K[^"]+'` matches `lang="` and then forgets it (`\K`), and then matches one or more characters that are not a double quote (`[^"]+`). This will give you the language code regardless of its format.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the `lang` attribute in the HTML tag. Here's an example command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]+' | head -1
```

This command uses the `-o` option to only output the matching part of the line, and the `-P` option to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions. The regular expression `(?<=lang=")[^"]+` matches any sequence of characters that comes after `lang="` and before the next double quote. The `head -1` command is used to only output the first match.

You can replace `yahoo.com` with any other URL you want to test.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
