Response A:



 To fix the "Module not found: Can't resolve 'popper.js'" error when importing Bootstrap and jQuery, you need to install Popper.js as a dependency in your project.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Popper.js using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install popper.js
```

2. After installing Popper.js, you should be able to import it in your JavaScript file along with Bootstrap and jQuery without any errors. Here's an example of how you can import them:

```javascript
import 'jquery';
import 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap';
```

Make sure to include these import statements at the beginning of your JavaScript file, before any other code that uses these libraries.

Response B:

The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires `Popper.js` for the tooltip and popover plugins. 

You can fix this issue by installing `Popper.js` via npm:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

After installing `Popper.js`, you need to import it in your file:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

If you're using Bootstrap with React, you might want to consider using `react-popper` instead, which is a wrapper around `Popper.js` for use with React.

```bash
npm install react-popper --save
```

And then import it:

```javascript
import { Popper } from 'react-popper';
```

Remember to restart your server after installing new packages.
