Response A:

In your script, you are using single quotes around the `$searchT` variable in the `grep` command. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `grep` command is looking for the literal string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable.

To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes around the `grep` command. This will allow the variable to be expanded and the `grep` command will search for the value of the variable.

Here's the updated script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt; then     
    echo "$(grep "$searchT" test.txt | wc -l) number of matches found"
    grep "$searchT" test.txt

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this updated script, we have removed the `cat` command and used the `grep` command directly. We have also removed the single quotes around the `$searchT` variable in the `grep` command and used double quotes instead. Finally, we have used the `grep` command directly in the `if` statement and checked its exit status to determine if there was a match or not.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:

The issue you're facing is due to the single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. Single quotes in bash prevent variable expansion, so `grep` is literally searching for the string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable `searchT`.

Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt) ]]; then     
    echo "$(grep -c "$searchT" test.txt) number of matches found"
    grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt
else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this corrected script, I've replaced the single quotes with double quotes around `$searchT` in the `grep` command. This allows `grep` to use the value of the variable `searchT`.

Also, I've replaced `cat test.txt | grep` with `grep ... test.txt` which is more efficient as it doesn't involve a useless use of `cat`.

Lastly, I've replaced `grep ... && wc -l` with `grep -c ...` to count the number of matching lines. The `-c` option in `grep` command prints only a count of matching lines. This is more efficient and accurate than piping the output of `grep` to `wc -l`.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
