Response A:



Here is the function:

```java
public static void removeFalseSubjects(List<Subject> subjects) {
    subjects.removeIf(subject -> !subject.status);
}
```

This function uses the `removeIf` method of the `List` interface, which removes all elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate. In this case, the predicate is `subject -> !subject.status`, which checks if the status of the subject is false. If the status is false, the subject is removed from the list.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

Here is the implementation of the `removeFalseSubjects` function in Java:

```java
public static void removeFalseSubjects(List<Subject> subjects) {
    Iterator<Subject> iterator = subjects.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Subject subject = iterator.next();
        if (!subject.isStatus()) {
            iterator.remove();
        }
    }
}
```

This function uses an iterator to traverse the `subjects` list and remove the objects whose `status` is false. The `iterator.remove()` method removes the current object from the list.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
