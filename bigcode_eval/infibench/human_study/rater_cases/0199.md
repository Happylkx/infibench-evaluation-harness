Response A:

Yes, Go modules support this kind of workflow. Here's an example Dockerfile that takes advantage of Docker's layer caching:

```Dockerfile
# Start from the latest golang base image
FROM golang:1.11-alpine as builder

# Add Maintainer Info
LABEL maintainer="Your Name <your.email@example.com>"

# Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go mod and sum files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download all dependencies. Dependencies will be cached if the go.mod and go.sum files are not changed
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source from the current directory to the Working Directory inside the container
COPY . .

# Build the Go app
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .

######## Start a new stage from scratch #######
FROM alpine:latest  

RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the Pre-built binary file from the previous stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Expose port 8080 to the outside world
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the executable
CMD ["./main"] 
```

In this Dockerfile, we first copy over the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files, then run `go mod download` to download the dependencies. This will be cached as a separate Docker layer, as long as the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files do not change.

Then we copy over the rest of the source code and build the application. This will not invalidate the Docker cache from the previous step, unless the `go.mod` or `go.sum` files change.

This way, you can take advantage of Docker's layer caching to speed up your builds.

Response B:



Yes, Go's module system (introduced in Go 1.11) does have a way to separate the dependency fetching and building stages in Docker. This is done by using a multi-stage build.

Here's a basic example of how you can do this:

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Fetch dependencies
FROM golang:1.11 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Stage 2: Build the application
FROM golang:1.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /go/pkg/mod /go/pkg/mod
COPY . .
RUN go build -o /myapp/myapp

# Final stage: Run the application
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /myapp
COPY --from=builder /myapp/myapp /myapp/myapp
CMD ["./myapp"]
```

In this example, the first stage (`builder`) fetches the dependencies using `go mod download`. The second stage then copies over the downloaded dependencies from the `builder` stage and builds the application. The final stage copies over the built application from the second stage and runs it.

This way, the dependency fetching stage can be cached, and only needs to be re-run when the `go.mod` or `go.sum` files change. The building stage can be cached separately, and only needs to be re-run when the source code changes.
