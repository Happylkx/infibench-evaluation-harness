------
Response A:

You can use the `groupby` method in pandas to group your DataFrame by column 'A', and then use the `idxmin` method to get the index of the minimum value in column 'B' for each group. After that, use the `loc` method to select these rows. Here is the function:

```python
def getMin(df):
    return df.loc[df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()]
```

This function works as follows:

1. `df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()` groups the DataFrame by column 'A', selects column 'B' for each group, and returns a Series where the index is the labels from 'A' and the values are the indices of the minimum values in 'B' for each group.
2. `df.loc[...]` selects the rows in the DataFrame with the indices specified by the Series.

So, if you call `getMin(df)`, it will return a DataFrame with the rows that have the minimum 'B' value for each 'A' value.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

You can use the `groupby` method of pandas DataFrame to group the rows by the values in column A, and then use the `idxmin` method to get the index of the row with the minimum value in column B for each group. Finally, you can use the `loc` method to select the rows with these indices.

Here's the code for the `getMin` function:

```python
def getMin(df):
    idx = df.groupby(['A'])['B'].idxmin()
    result = df.loc[idx]
    return result
```

You can call this function with the example DataFrame you provided:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
                   'B': [4, 5, 2, 7, 4, 6],
                   'C': [3, 4, 10, 2, 4, 6]})

result = getMin(df)
print(result)
```

This will output:

```
   A  B   C
2  1  2  10
4  2  4   4
```

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
