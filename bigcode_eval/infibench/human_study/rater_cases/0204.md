Response A:

Sure, here is a function that does what you asked for:

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

def filterExcelRows(filePath, matchedString):
    # Load the workbook
    wb = load_workbook(filename = filePath)
    # Select the first sheet
    sheet = wb['Sheet1']
    
    matched_rows = []
    
    # Iterate over the rows
    for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True):
        # If the matchedString is in the row
        if matchedString in row:
            # Append the row index to the list
            matched_rows.append(row[0])
            
    return matched_rows
```

This function will return a list of the indexes of the rows that contain the `matchedString`. Note that this function assumes that the `matchedString` is not in the first cell of the row (the index cell). If it can be in the first cell, you should modify the function to handle this case.

Also, please note that the row indices are 1-based, not 0-based. That is, the first row is row 1, not row 0. This is because Excel itself is 1-based, not 0-based.

This function also assumes that the `matchedString` can only appear once in a row. If it can appear multiple times in a row, you should modify the function to handle this case.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



Please write the function in python.

 ```python
import openpyxl

def filterExcelRows(filePath, matchedString):
    # Load the workbook
    workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(filePath)

    # Select the sheet
    sheet = workbook['Sheet1']

    # Initialize an empty list to store the row indexes
    row_indexes = []

    # Iterate over the rows in the sheet
    for row in sheet.iter_rows():
        # Iterate over the cells in the row
        for cell in row:
            # Check if the cell value matches the matched string
            if cell.value == matchedString:
                # If it does, add the row index to the list
                row_indexes.append(cell.row)
                break

    # Return the list of row indexes
    return row_indexes
```

This function takes a file path and a matched string as arguments. It loads the workbook using `openpyxl.load_workbook()`, selects the sheet named 'Sheet1', and initializes an empty list to store the row indexes.

The function then iterates over the rows in the sheet using `sheet.iter_rows()`. For each row, it iterates over the cells in the row using a `for` loop. If the cell value matches the matched string, it adds the row index to the list of row indexes using `row_indexes.append(cell.row)`.

Finally, the function returns the list of row indexes.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
