------
Response A:

The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` indicates that Python cannot find the module named 'app'. This is likely because the `app` directory is not being correctly copied into the Docker image.

In your Dockerfile, you are setting the working directory to `/app` and then copying the `app` directory into the working directory. This means the `app` directory is actually being copied to `/app/app`, not `/app` as you might expect.

To fix this, you can change the `COPY` command to copy the contents of the `app` directory into the working directory, rather than the directory itself. Here's how you can revise your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./app/ ./

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this revised Dockerfile, `COPY ./app/ ./` will copy the contents of the `app` directory (on your host machine) into the current working directory (in the Docker image). Also, the command to start the server has been changed from `app.main:app` to `main:app` because now `main.py` is in the working directory, not in a subdirectory named `app`.

Response B:

It seems like the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try updating the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to include the parent directory of the `app` module. 

Here's an updated Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./fastapi /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this updated Dockerfile, we are copying the `fastapi` directory to the `/app` directory in the container. This should include the `app` module and its dependencies. 

Also, make sure that the `docker-compose.yml` file has the correct path to the Dockerfile. It should be something like this:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

With these changes, you should be able to run `docker-compose up -d` without any errors.
