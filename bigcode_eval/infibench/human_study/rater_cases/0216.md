Response A:

Sure, you can use the `calendar` module in Python to check if a year is a leap year or not. Here is the function you asked for:

```python
import calendar

def DaysInYear(year):
    if calendar.isleap(year):
        return 366
    else:
        return 365
```

This function takes a year as an integer argument and returns the total number of days in that year. The `calendar.isleap(year)` function returns `True` if the year is a leap year, and `False` otherwise.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



Yes, you can calculate the total number of days in a year using the `is_leap` function from the `calendar` module in Python. Here's a function `DaysInYear` that takes a year as an argument and returns the number of days in that year:

```python
import calendar

def DaysInYear(year):
    if calendar.isleap(year):
        return 366
    else:
        return 365
```

You can use this function to calculate the total number of days in a year for any given date in a Pandas DataFrame. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2020-03-30', '2019-03-30']})

# Convert the 'date' column to datetime format
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# Extract the year from the 'date' column
df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year

# Calculate the total number of days in each year using the DaysInYear function
df['days_in_year'] = df['year'].apply(DaysInYear)

print(df)
```

This will output:

```
        date  year  days_in_year
0 2020-03-30  2020            366
1 2019-03-30  2019            365
```

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
