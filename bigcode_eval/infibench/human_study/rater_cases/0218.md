Response A:

Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in dark mode using CSS media queries. The `prefers-color-scheme` media feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* CSS for dark mode */
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* CSS for light mode */
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}
```

In this example, if the user's system is in dark mode, the background color of the body will be black and the text color will be white. If the system is in light mode, the background color will be white and the text color will be black.

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1, Firefox 67, and Chrome 76 and later versions.

Please note that the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature respects the user's system setting, so it's a good practice to provide a manual toggle for the users to switch between light and dark mode on your website.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

Response B:



Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox by using the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature in CSS. This feature allows you to apply different styles based on the user's preference for light or dark color themes.

Here's an example of how you can use it:

```css
body {
  background-color: #fff; /* Default background color for light mode */
  color: #000; /* Default text color for light mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: #000; /* Background color for dark mode */
    color: #fff; /* Text color for dark mode */
  }
}
```

In this example, the default styles are applied for light mode. When the user's system is in Dark Mode, the styles inside the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block are applied instead.

You can also use JavaScript to detect the user's preference for dark mode and apply styles accordingly. Here's an example using the `matchMedia` method:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // Apply dark mode styles
} else {
  // Apply light mode styles
}
```

In this example, the `matchMedia` method is used to check if the user's system is in Dark Mode. If it is, the dark mode styles are applied; otherwise, the light mode styles are applied.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
