Response A:



Here is the function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\s*\([^)]*\)', '', regex=True)
    return df
```

This function uses the `str.replace` method to remove any text that is enclosed in parentheses. The regular expression `'\s*\([^)]*\)'` matches any whitespace followed by a parenthesized group of characters. The `regex=True` argument is used to indicate that the pattern is a regular expression. The replaced text is an empty string, which effectively removes the parenthesized group from the original text. The modified DataFrame is then returned.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

You can use the `str.replace` function in pandas to replace the special characters with an empty string. Here is the function you asked for:

```python
def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\(.*\)', '')
    return df
```

This function uses a regular expression to match any characters between parentheses and replaces them with an empty string. The `.*` in the regular expression matches any character (except a newline) 0 or more times.

Please note that this function will modify the input DataFrame `df` directly. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, you should create a copy of the DataFrame inside the function:

```python
def remove(df):
    df = df.copy()
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\(.*\)', '')
    return df
```

Also, please note that this function will remove all characters between parentheses, not just at the end of the string. If you want to only remove characters between parentheses at the end of the string, you can use the regular expression `r'\(.*\)$'` instead:

```python
def remove(df):
    df = df.copy()
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\(.*\)$', '')
    return df
```

The `$` in the regular expression matches the end of the string.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
