Response A:

Sure, you can use the `*` wildcard to catch all the remaining path. Here is the revised route pattern:

```javascript
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/*
```

This pattern will match all of the following routes:

- `route/aa/config`
- `route/aa/config/bb`
- `route/aa/config/bb/cc`

In your route handler, you can then parse the remaining path as you need.

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

Sure! Here's the revised route pattern that should fulfill your requirement:

```
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/:OptionalParam3?
```

This pattern will match all three examples you provided:

- `/route/aa/config`
- `/route/aa/config/bb`
- `/route/aa/config/bb/cc`

The `:param1` parameter is required, while `:OptionalParam2` and `:OptionalParam3` are both optional. The `?` character after each optional parameter indicates that it may or may not be present in the URL.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
