Response A:



Here is the function:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Add a new dimension to d
    d = d.unsqueeze(2)
    # Concatenate inps and d along the new dimension
    return torch.cat((inps, d), dim=2)
```

This function first adds a new dimension to `d` using the `unsqueeze` method, which increases the dimensionality of `d` from 2 to 3. Then, it concatenates `inps` and `d` along the new dimension using the `cat` method, which results in a tensor of size [64, 161, 2].

Response A is better [ ] (label [x] to select)

-------
Response B:

You can use the `torch.unsqueeze()` function to add a new dimension to the tensor `d` and then concatenate it with `inps` along the last dimension using the `torch.cat()` function. Here's the implementation of the `addTensor()` function:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    d = torch.unsqueeze(d, dim=2)
    out = torch.cat((inps, d), dim=2)
    return out
```

You can call this function with your tensors `inps` and `d` as arguments to get the desired output tensor:

```python
inps = torch.randn(64, 161, 1)
d = torch.randn(64, 161)
out = addTensor(inps, d)
print(out.size())  # Output: torch.Size([64, 161, 2])
```

Response B is better [ ] (label [x]) to select)

-------

Response A and B are equally good [ ] (label [x]) to select
Response A and B are equally bad [ ] (label [x]) to select
